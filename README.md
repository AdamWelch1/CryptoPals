# CryptoPals

Requires libtomcrypt.

My intention with this repository is not to have completed each challenge chronologically or to the __exact__ specifications outlined in each challenge.
Really, I was just doing the challenges that I was interested in as an attempt to learn a little bit more about cryptography and how it can be broken.
